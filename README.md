# CivicContracts

CivicContracts is the CivicSuite module for central contract registry support, clause topic lookup, expiration tracking, renewal visibility, and public-records-aware exports.

Current state: **v0.1.1 contract repository foundation plus registry persistence release**. This repo ships a FastAPI package, health/root endpoints, documentation gates, deterministic sample contract registry, clause topic lookup, expiration tracking helper, renewal visibility helper, optional database-backed contract registry and renewal visibility records, public-records export checklist, and accessible public sample UI at `/civiccontracts`, aligned to `civiccore==0.3.0`. It does **not** ship live contract management platforms, official legal interpretation, legal advice, live LLM calls, contract execution workflows, or contract system-of-record integrations.

## What CivicContracts Does

- Create sample contract registry stubs and review notes.
- Persist contract registry and renewal visibility records when `CIVICCONTRACTS_REGISTRY_DB_URL` is configured.
- Flag common clause topics for staff/legal review.
- Build expiration reminder plans.
- Summarize renewal visibility without approving renewals.
- Produce public-records-aware export checklists.
- Demonstrate a public contract-support UI at `/civiccontracts`.

## What CivicContracts Does Not Do

- It does not interpret legal obligations.
- It does not approve renewals or execute contracts.
- It does not provide legal advice.
- It does not call live LLMs in v0.1.1.
- It does not replace a contract system of record.
